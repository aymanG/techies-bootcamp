### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Over-engineering early phases
- ❌ Complex prerequisites chains
- ❌ Slow container starts
- ❌ Expensive always-on resources
- ❌ Poor mobile experience

### Technical Decisions
- **Why Fargate Spot?** 70% cheaper, perfect for short tasks
- **Why DynamoDB?** Serverless, scales to zero
- **Why Cognito?** 50K free users, managed auth
- **Why Lambda?** No idle costs, auto-scaling
- **Why S3+CloudFront?** Global CDN, cheap hosting

## Implementation Order

### Week 1 Sprint
```bash
Day 1-2: S3 + CloudFront setup
Day 3-4: Cognito + basic auth Lambda
Day 5-6: Simple frontend with login
Day 7: Testing and cost validation
```

### Daily Success Criteria
- Day 1: Static site live on S3
- Day 2: CloudFront distribution working
- Day 3: Users can register in Cognito
- Day 4: Login returns JWT token
- Day 5: Frontend shows logged-in state
- Day 6: Profile page displays user info
- Day 7: All features work on mobile

## Cost Projections

### Phase 1-2 Costs (Foundation)
- S3 + CloudFront: $2-3/month
- Cognito: Free (< 50K users)
- Lambda + API Gateway: $2-3/month
- DynamoDB: $2-3/month
- **Total: ~$8/month**

### Phase 3-5 Costs (With Containers)
- Previous: $8/month
- Fargate Spot: $5-10/month (depends on usage)
- Additional Lambda invocations: $2/month
- **Total: ~$20/month**

### At Scale (1000 active users)
- Assumes 3 containers/user/month
- 30 minutes average session
- **Total: ~$30-50/month**
- **Per user: $0.03-0.05/month**

## Let's Start!

Ready to begin Phase 1? I'll provide:

1. **Complete working code for Phase 1** (S3 + Cognito + Lambda)
2. **Step-by-step deployment guide**
3. **Testing checklist**
4. **Cost monitoring setup**

This phased approach ensures:
- ✅ Each piece works before moving on
- ✅ Costs stay predictable
- ✅ Easy to troubleshoot
- ✅ Quick wins build momentum
- ✅ Users can start learning in Week 2

Which phase would you like to implement first? I recommend starting with Phase 1 as it's the foundation everything else builds on.
